# arduino-vlc-project

An example Arduino project that launches a random vlc tv show when a switch is flipped.


You'll have to update the path to your movie folder but otherwise this code should be pretty plug and play


# Installation
Just run npm intall. You'll need a newer version of node.js (4.0+) as I use promises and 'lets' for variables.

```
npm install
```



If you have any questions or suggestions please feel free to open an issue.
