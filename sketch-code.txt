/*
  Button

 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital
 pin 13, when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 2.


 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground
 * pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
 * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

 * Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
 attached to pin 13.

// constants won't change. They're used here to
// set pin numbers:
const int buttonPin = 2;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin =  13;      // the number of the LED pin

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);      // open the serial port at 9600 bps: 
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton ibuttonPins pressed.
  // if it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
//    Serial.println("high");
    Serial.write(0);
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
  //  Serial.println("low");
    Serial.write(1);
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
//Delay is not needed but makes using without a proper switch a bit nicer
  delay(2000);
